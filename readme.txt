AUTHOR: Mason V. Tea
UPDATED: April 20, 2020

This directory contains all the documents and programs I (Mason V. Tea)
utilized over the course of my work on the
Solar  Gravitational Lens (SGL) project.
This readme provides an inexhaustive description of the contents
herein, by directory.


>>> /documents

Various papers and references I found useful enough to save. (More
important materiial can be found in the references of my own
paper which I wrote alongside my talk for KNAC 2019, located
at /documents/summer19/knac/tea_KNAC_paper_2019.pdf.)

* /cambridge contains various chapters of
[this book](http://www.cambridge.org/core_title/gb/461266)
that I found useful.

* /diagrams contains a few useful diagrams.

* /papers contains various papers that reference the SGL;
most of these are referenced in my 2019 KNAC paper, mentioned
above.

* sgl_decon is a Pages document outlining the roadmap of the
deconvolution process for SGL images.

* sgl_mission.pdf is aa brief summary of the relevant
parameters to consider in regards to the SGL system.

* sgl_software.pdf is a review of various available softwares
for strong gravitational lensing, with a focus on their relevance
and usefulness to the SGL project.

* sgl_summary.pdf is a brief summary of the SGL concept.

* summer19/etc contains various drafts of abstracts and bios
from the 2019 summer RitS program at Wesleyan.

* /summer19/knac contains my 2019 talk
(tea_KNAC_talk_2019.pptx) as well as the corresponding paper
(tea_KNAC_paper_2019.pdf).

* summer_2019_poster.pdf is the poster I presented at
Wesleyan as part of my Summer Research in the Sciences fellowship.

>>> /grav_tele

A series of scripts used to calculate some of the parameters
of the SGL. Note that many of these scrips are from early in
my undergrad, so they're likely fairly messy.

* d_focal.py computes the minimum focal distance of light passing
the Sun at an impact parameter equal to the radius of the Sun.

* grave_tele_composite.py essentially performs all of the
functions of the other scripts in this directory at once; calculates
the deflection of light due to plasma in the solar
corona as a function of impact parameter, critical frequency of
light as a function of impact parameter, as well as focal
distances for the Sun and deflection angles of light for various
impact parameters.

* mass_v_focal.py plots focal distance as a function of stellar
mass and radius.

* turyshev_andersson_revised.py plots plasma deflection in the solar corona as a function of
impact parameter, as well as effective focal distance as a function
of impact parameter.

*/lenstest contains the Bolton script with some custom parameters
set to play around with.

>>> /not_my_code

This directory contains various programs from other authors that
I tried out, mostly in preparing for the software review document
(see /documents). These include:

- [Bolton's Python Strong Lensing Demo](http://www.physics.utah.edu/~bolton/python_lens_demo/)

- [Gravispy](https://github.com/cjayross/gravispy)

- [rantonels' "Starless" black hole simulation](http://rantonels.github.io/starless/)

- [Refractor](https://github.com/montefiore-ai/refractor)


>>> suntracer

This directory contains all versions, including the mother script,
of my general-relativistic, raytracing lensing simulation, which
I call SunTracer. It is an adaptation of
[Jorge Jimenez-Vicente's inverse ray-shooting code](http://research.iac.es/winterschool/2012/media/IRS1.pdf),
modified to suit the conditions of the SGL.

The purpose of SunTracer
was to simulate the class of images that would be gathered by
the SGL upon its launch, namely Einstein rings generated from
the source image (a planet). SunTracer maps photons (in
this case, pixels) with a one-to-one correspondence from the source
to the image plane, utilizing the thin lens approximation to
calculate the trajectory of each photon around the Sun.

* aux.py contains many of the functions I utilized to perform
calculations for the simulation, as well as the calculations
in /grav_tele's scripts.

* /img contains an almost uncountable amount of images used
in and generated by SunTracer.

* psf.py plots magnification of the SGL as a function of
offset from the optical axis (essentially a cross-section
of the SGL's point spread function).

All files with the prefix suntracer_ are modifications
of the mother script, suntracer.py, which contains the raytracing
and photon-mapping code. The modified versions of this code
exist only to automate the image generation process or test
certain special cases.
